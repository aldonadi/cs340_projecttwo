Areas for Improvement (Minor Enhancements):
- [X] Currently, find() returns MongoDBâ€™s _id field, which is not always needed by users. 
      To improve usability, exclude _id unless explicitly requested.

- [X] Currently, update() and delete() return raw MongoDB metadata, which includes unnecessary fields.
      Instead, return structured responses with meaningful success indicators.

- [X] While the README explains CRUD operations well, adding sample function calls would improve clarity.
